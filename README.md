# 🤟 Real-Time Sign Language Recognition Using YOLOv5

## 📌 Project Overview
Sign Language Recognition System that uses **YOLOv5** and **Computer Vision** to detect and recognize hand gestures in real time through a webcam. The system helps bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and others by translating sign language gestures into understandable outputs.

The project was developed as part of an academic and practical machine learning initiative, focusing on object detection, deep learning, and human-computer interaction.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect sign language gestures in real time.
- Improve communication accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals.
- Apply deep learning-based object detection using YOLOv5.
- Demonstrate practical implementation of AI in assistive technologies.
- Build a scalable framework that can be extended to larger sign language vocabularies.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Real-time sign language detection using webcam input.
- YOLOv5-based object detection model.
- Custom-trained dataset for sign recognition.
- Fast and accurate predictions.
- Easy-to-use execution workflow.
- Extensible architecture for adding new gestures.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
Images of different sign language gestures are captured using the webcam through `capture_image.py`.

Current gesture classes:
- Hello
- Yes
- No
- Thanks
- I Love You
- Please

### 2. Data Annotation
Collected images are annotated using the LabelImg tool to generate bounding box labels required for training.

### 3. Model Training
The annotated dataset is used to train a custom YOLOv5 model capable of detecting sign language gestures.

### 4. Real-Time Detection
The trained model (`best.pt`) is loaded and executed using:

```python
python detect.py --weights best.pt --img 416 --conf 0.5 --source 0
```

The webcam feed is analyzed in real time and detected signs are displayed instantly.
